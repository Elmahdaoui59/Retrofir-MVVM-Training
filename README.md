# Retrofir-MVVM-Training
===================================

Code source for an android App built during the learning of android development with Kotlin

##Introduction:
------------

I think building some complete projects is a great way to understand not only each topic but also how things are linked to each other.
I was learning about RecyclreView and adapter, Then I decided to use it to display a list of strings stored in the apps, and I said way not to push things further again by fetching some content from the internet and displaying it in the recyclerView.
After some research, I realized that this can be done using "Retrofit"

### I followed this codelab from google to get familiar with retrofit2:

#### I  used this website to get  a free fake API for the test :
